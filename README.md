RUCOPG, a Rather Uninteresting Cube Oriented Puzzle Game

Still in development, and does not have the game logic integrated with the renderer. The renderer is also rather stupidly implemented, so that will have to be changed a bit as well.

Currently renders a bunch of cubes on a 3d grid based on what is written in "fieldInit.txt".

This document will be updated once everything is actually complete.

Controls:
Arrow keys to navigate the 3d grid.
